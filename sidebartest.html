          <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
          <p>--This is all placeholder text. Need to replace--Once the stuff of science fiction, virtual reality is on the cusp of becoming part of our day-to-day lives thanks to mounting technological advances. Many popular VR headsets are ushering in exciting new ways to play and interact with the world. As these devices continue to evolve, we believe that EEG algorithms can add the extra layer of immersion needed to truly complete the virtual reality experience.</p>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/vr-gadget.jpg" alt="VR gadget"></p>
		  <p>Swiss neurotechnology company MindMaze has conceived the ultimate — or at least somewhere around the penultimate — cyberpunk VR setup. Imagine a blocky virtual reality headset that looks like a bezeled Oculus Rift. Where a Rift developer might track your hands by mounting a Leap Motion to the front of the headset, MindMaze has integrated a Kinect-like combination of cameras and depth sensors, capable of finding your hands with some degree of accuracy. Instead of a strap, though, there's a rope-and-plastic net that covers the crown of your head.</p>
		  <p>And, theoretically, reads your thoughts.</p>

              <h4>NeuroPrivacy</h4>
              <p>Scientists believe the ability to scan brain activity has the potential to yield knowledge about the inner 
workings of an individual’s brain. Some researchers al
ready claim to be able to discover certain unconscious 
preferences or to detect when someone is lying about
 being exposed to certain information based upon cerebral 
activity. Brain research is beginning to raise numerous
 legal and social policy questions including: What 
information is going to be discovered? Who will have access to it? How will the information be used? What 
privacy rights does a person have to his or her thoughts?</p>
              <p>The study of the ethical, legal and social implicati
ons of neuroscience is being referred to “neuroethics.”
1
Many types of brain research have, or will have, legal 
implications. However, this article will focus on the 
privacy concerns with respect to mental and cerebral functioning as delineated through brain imaging and other 
neurodiagnostic techniques—or what will 
be referred to here as “neuroprivacy.”</p>
			  <p>The purpose of this report is to view potential legal 
questions within the context of existing brain imaging 
technology, applications and protections. The first sect
ion summarizes current technologies. The reliability of 
these technologies will be addressed in the second section. 
Potential applications of this technology and some of 
the legal implications will be discussed in the third sect
ion. The fourth section will review existing protections. 
Lastly, issues that have arisen in the area of genetic pr
ivacy will be reviewed and compared to similar concerns

              <h4>Anxiety</h4>
              <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) feedback, also known as neurofeedback or neurotherapy, was originally developed as a relaxation technique related to meditation (Kamiya, 1969; Michael, Krishnaswamy, & Mohamed, 2005). EEG involves measuring the general patterns of activity of the brain and can be used as a diagnostic assistant (usually via quantitative EEG or qEEG) or feedback tool (Hammond, 2010, 2011). Feedback can be auditory or visual, even in the form of a computer game. In this way, participants learn to regulate specific frequencies of cortical activity. As a feedback therapy, it has been used in many different psychological and medical disorders, including attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and substance use disorder (Myers & Young, 2012). It has also been used to treat the more cognitive components of anxiety disorders and may be more effective in those disorders in which the cognitive experience is central, such as generalized anxiety disorder (Schoenberg & David, 2014). Most practitioners claim there is little to no short-or long-term risk involved in neurofeedback, but some caution that to minimize risk it is critical to individualize treatment using qEEG because of the heterogeneity of EEG presentations of various disorders and comorbidities (Hammond, 2010; Walker, 2010).</p>

              <section id="PTSD">
              <h4>PTSD</h4>
              <p>The majority of PTSD patients continue to have substantial symptoms after treatment ends. Less than half of those entering psychotherapy improved significantly. Treatments for combat-related trauma showed the lowest level of benefit. Even the most effective available treatments do not result in full recovery for the majority of veterans with PTSD. In published research and our experience, neurofeedback is consistently helpful in reducing or eliminating the symptoms of PTSD. </p>
			  <p>Neurofeedback, also called EEG biofeedback or neurotherapy, is a research proven way to help you improve your brain function through intensive brain training exercises. Although the technology is quite sophisticated, the process is simple, painless, and non-invasive. It is just learning. You learn to alter your brain activity the same way you learn every other skill – through feedback and practice.</p>
              <p>What is new in neurofeedback is that you are guided by a form of feedback that was previously not available to you – instantaneous information about changes in your brain’s electrical activity. Every half second, your brain activity is compared to your targets for change. You get a signal and “reward” when you meet the goal. No signal or reward when you do not.</p>
              <p>In 20 neurofeedback sessions, with feedback every half second, you get 72,000 chances to learn. That’s a lot of repetition and practice. Brain science has shown that repetitive exercise of brain networks reshapes the brain. Neurofeedback allows you to reshape our brain. Learn more.</p>
              <p>Four studies have been completed looking at the effectiveness of neurofeedback for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults.  One study has been completed with children. These studies all suggest that neurofeedback is a very promising approach to treatment.  This is especially important because existing treatments have limited effectiveness for many individuals with PTSD.</p>
              <p>Our clinical experience and that of other experts in PTSD treatment shows that neurofeedback is often very helpful with PTSD.  Ten weeks of neurofeedback has consistently resulted in significant improvement in children and adults with PTSD.  We have provided training and consultation in the use of neurofeedback to four residential treatment centers for children with trauma related difficulties.  Each of these programs has found neurofeedback to be very helpful to their kids. After an initial period of evaluation, each center decided to add neurofeedback to the treatment regimen in the residence.</p>
              <p>If you continue to suffer from the symptoms of PTSD despite treatment with medication and or psychotherapy, the results of this early research suggest that you consider neurofeedback.</p>
              <p>Neuroscience is increasingly showing the basis in the brain for PTSD. Multiple qEEG studies have been published showing excessive cortical activation with PTSD. However, every person with PTSD does not have the same brain profile. That’s why we measure brain function with every neurofeedback client using a quantitative EEG “brain map” so that you can see the reason for your difficulties. The image below is from the qEEG analysis of one of our clients with PTSD. The area in red shows excessive activation in part of the fear network in the brain. Once we see the source of the problem, we target that area for change through neurofeedback brain training. This allows you to get to the root of the problem and reshape your brain, not just mask your symptoms. Learn more.</p>

          <h2>Cognitive Training</h2>
              <section id="Ageing">
              <h4>Ageing</h4>
              <p>Cognitivecontrol is defined by a set
of neural processes that allow us to
interact with our complex environment in a goal-directed manner.
Humans regularly challenge these control processes when attempting
to simultaneously accomplish multip
le goals (multitasking), generat-
ing interference as the result of fundamental information processing
limitations. It is clear that multitasking behaviour has become ubiquitous in today’s technologically dense world, and substantial evidence has accrued regarding multit
asking difficulties and cognitive
control deficits in our ageing population. Here we show that multi-
tasking performance, as assessed with a custom-designed three-
dimensional video game (NeuroRacer), exhibits a linear age-related
decline from 20 to 79 years of age. By playing an adaptive version of
NeuroRacer in multitasking training mode, older adults (60 to 85
years old) reduced multitasking costs compared to both an active
control group and a no-contact control group, attaining levels beyond
those achieved by untrained 20-year-old participants, with gains
persisting for 6 months. Furthermore, age-related deficits in neural
signatures of cognitive control, as measured with electroencephalo-
graphy, were remediated by multitasking training (enhanced midline
frontal theta power and frontal–post
erior theta coherence). Critically,
thistraining resulted in performance benefits thatextended to untrained
cognitive control abilities (enhanced sustained attention and working
memory), with an increase in midline frontal theta power predicting
the training-induced boost in sustained attention and preservation
of multitasking improvement 6 months later. These findings highlight the robust plasticity of the prefrontal cognitive control system
in the ageing brain, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge,
ofhowacustom-designedvideogamecanbeusedtoassesscognitive
abilities across the lifespan, evaluate underlying neural mechanisms,
and serve as a powerful tool for cognitive enhancement.</p>

              <section id="EarlyDevelopment">
              <h4>Early Development</h4>
              <p>In human participants, the intensive practice of particular cognitive activities can induce sustained improvements in cognitive performance, which in some cases transfer to benefits on untrained activities. Despite the growing body of research examining the behavioral effects of cognitive training in children, no studies have explored directly the neural basis of these training effects in a systematic, controlled fashion. Therefore, the impact of training on brain neurophysiology in childhood, and the mechanisms by which benefits may be achieved, are unknown. Here, we apply new methods to examine dynamic neurophysiological connectivity in the context of a randomized trial of adaptive working memory training undertaken in children. After training, connectivity between frontoparietal networks and both lateral occipital complex and inferior temporal cortex was altered. Furthermore, improvements in working memory after training were associated with increased strength of neural connectivity at rest, with the magnitude of these specific neurophysiological changes being mirrored by individual gains in untrained working memory performance.</p>
              <p>Working memory—the ability to hold in mind and manipulate small amounts of information for brief periods of time—is a key requirement for many everyday tasks and is considered a critical influence on educational progress during childhood (Gathercole et al., 2003). Training working memory can result in task performance benefits that transfer to similarly structured, but untrained tasks (Holmes et al., 2009; Dunning et al., 2013). Cognitive training has therefore been considered of potential therapeutic benefit for the remediation of cognitive deficits associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Klingberg et al., 2005), acquired brain damage (Westerberg et al., 2007) and aging (Anguera et al., 2013). However, despite the growing interest in cognitive training and claims made about its potential, we know very little about the neural mechanisms by which training influences cognitive abilities. This is because it is difficult to combine longitudinal neuroimaging investigation with systematically controlled interventions, and this is even more true in target populations such as children (Jolles et al., 2012; Rueda et al., 2012). As a result, no study has yet explored whether and how cognitive training alters neurophysiology during childhood.</p>
              <p>Tasks that tax working memory recruit areas in frontal and parietal cortex, overlapping with networks associated with attentional control (for review, see Duncan, 2010). A popular account linking frontoparietal activity to working memory performance is that activity in these domain-general networks codes information about fluctuating task goals. During control-demanding tasks, long-range functional connections between frontoparietal networks and other cortical areas integrate this higher-order information with ongoing processing in lower-level domain-specific systems (Stokes, 2011). The dynamic regulation of this functional connectivity provides a basis for integrating and optimizing lower-level sensory processes necessary in attention-demanding situations or when attempting to maintain multiple items in working memory (Gazzaley and Nobre, 2012). Similar functional interactions have been implicated in working memory performance during childhood (Astle et al., 2014; Barnes et al., 2015). However, the extent to which the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying efficient working memory performance can be modified by training is unknown.</p>

              <h4>Mindfulness</h4>
              <p>In this study, we tested whether functional connectivity is altered in childhood by intensive working memory training and, if so, whether intrinsic changes in connectivity “at rest” are associated with any improvements in children's memory capacity. To test these hypotheses, 27 typically developing children, aged 8–11 years old, completed 20 sessions of computerized working memory training at home. Children were randomly assigned to an adaptive or placebo condition. Before and after training, all children underwent a 9 min resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) scan and completed standardized assessments of short-term and working memory. We then used resting-state MEG data to reconstruct electrophysiological oscillatory activity within the whole brain before and after training. Examining correlations in oscillatory activity allowed us to investigate whether cognitive training had any influence upon neurophysiological connections between frontoparietal networks and cortical areas typically recruited for working memory or attentional control and how these changes relate to gains in memory capacity measured outside the scanner.</p>
