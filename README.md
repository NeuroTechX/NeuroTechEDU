* To add more items to the scrolling sidebar, add a <section> with a specific ID, then reference that ID in an <a> tag of the sidebar
* For more information on how sidebar functions, [see this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-bootstraps-affix-scrollspy-plugins/)

* You can add a dropdown function to the nav menu using the example in the template (inside comments). [More info can be found on their website](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns)
